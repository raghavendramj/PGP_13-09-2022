Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

Building Blocks / Components of a graph!
Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph
Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph

Types Of Graph

1. Null graph!
	-> a graph with no edges is known as Null graph!

2. Trivial Graph
	-> Having only single vertex.
	-> It is also the smallest graph ever possible!

3. Undirected graph
	-> In which edges don't have any direction

4. Directed graph
	-> In which edge has direction

5. Connected graph
	-> In which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph

6. Disconnected graph
	-> in which at least one node is not reachable from a node

7. Regular Graph
	-> The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to the other vertices of the graph. Let the degree of each vertex be K then the graph

8. Complete Graph
	-> The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.

9. Cycle Graph
	The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree of each vertex is 2.

10. Cyclic Graph
	A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

11. Weighted Graph
	A graph where each of edges also holds a data value.


Trees :-
In the tree in data structures, the node that is the predecessor of any node is known as a parent node, or a node with a branch from itself to any other successive node is called the parent node.

Child
	The node, a descendant of any node, is known as child nodes in data structures.
	In a tree, any number of parent nodes can have any number of child nodes.
	In a tree, every node except the root node is a child node


Siblings
	In trees in the data structure, nodes that belong to the same parent are called siblings.

Leaf
	Trees in the data structure, the node with no child, is known as a leaf node.
	In trees, leaf nodes are also called external nodes or terminal nodes

Degree
	In the tree data structure, the total number of children of a node is called the degree of the node.
	The highest degree of the node among all the nodes in a tree is called the Degree of Tree.

Level
In tree data structures, the root node is said to be at level 0, and the root node's children are at level 1, and the children of that node at level 1 will be level 2, and so on.

Height
In a tree data structure, the number of edges from the leaf node to the particular node in the longest path is known as the height of that node.
In the tree, the height of the root node is called "Height of Tree".

Depth
In a tree, many edges from the root node to the particular node are called the depth of the tree.
In the tree, the total number of edges from the root node to the leaf node in the longest path is known as "Depth of Tree".

Types of Tree in Data Structure
The following are the different types of trees in data structure:

Binary tree
In a binary tree, every element/parent node has at most 2 children. Each node can have either 0, 1, or 2 children. Typically, the 2 children are called the left child and the right child.
 
Properties of a Binary tree

A binary tree is either an empty tree or consists of a node called the root node, a left subtree, and a right subtree. The subtrees will also act as a binary tree once.
The top-most node is called the root.
A node without children is called a leaf node or terminal node.
The maximum number of nodes at each level of i is 2^i 
	Level -> 0 -> 2^0 -> 1
	Level -> 1 -> 2^1 -> 2
	Level -> 2 -> 2^2 -> 4
	Level -> 3 -> 2^3 -> 8
	Level -> 4 -> 2^4 -> 16
Height of the tree = the longest path from the root node to the leaf node.
Depth of a node = the length of the path to its root.


Binary trees can be divided into the following types:
	Perfect binary tree: Every internal node has two child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same level.
	Full binary tree: Every parent node or an internal node has either exactly two children or no child nodes.
	Complete binary tree: All levels except the last one are full with nodes. 
	
Tree Traversal - inorder, preorder and postorder
 
Inorder:- 
Traverse the left subtree in disorder
Examine the root ->print(node);
Traverse the right subtree in disorder

void inOrder(Node node){
	if(node == null)
		return;
	inOrder(node.left);
	System.out.println(node.value +" -> ");
	inOrder(node.right); 
}

Preorder
Examine the root
Traverse the left subtree in preorder
Traverse the right subtree in preorder

void preOrder(Node node){
	if(node == null)
		return;
	System.out.println(node.value +" -> ");
	preOrder(node.left);
	preOrder(node.right); 
}
 
Postorder
Traverse the left sub-tree in postorder
Travel the right sub-tree in postorder
Examine the root 

void postOrder(Node node){
	if(node == null)
		return;
	postOrder(node.left);
	postOrder(node.right); 
	System.out.println(node.value +" -> ");
} 

Q1. Find the Maximum Depth or Height of given Binary Tree

int height(Node node){
	if(node == null){
		return 0;
	}	
	int leftHeight =  height(node.left);
	int rightHeight =  height(node.right);	
	return 1+ Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
}
