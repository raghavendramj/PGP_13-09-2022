Question :- find minimum distance from source to destination graph?
Question :- Detect cycle in an undirected graph
			    Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.


Detect cycle in a directed graph
	Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.

Topological Sorting
	Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

What is a Disjoint set data structure?
	Two sets are called disjoint sets if they don’t have any element in common, the intersection of sets is a null set.

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:
	Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
	Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
	Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
	Check if two sets are disjoint or not.
